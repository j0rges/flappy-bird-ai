# Flappy Bird AI

A small project which consists of a simple flappy bird browser game (no bells
or whistles yet) and a simple AI player which will learn using genetic
algorithms.

It is just a small project I am doing for fun.

## Usage

If you want to play the game you can clone this repository, then install the
dependencies and start the server:

```bash
npm ci
node server.js
```

You will be able to find it in [http://localhost:8080/flappyBird.html](http://localhost:8080/flappyBird.html). Note that I have only tested it on Chrome, so
I can't make any promises about other browsers.

Once the page has loaded, press the space bar to start the game and subsequently
to jump. You can use the key 'p' to pause the game and then resume
by pressing either the space bar or 'p' again. After you lose just press the
space bar to start again.

Alternatively, instead of pressing the space bar to start, you can press any
other key to start the first generation of AI players. Once they all die, press
any key except the space bar again to start the next generation. You can always
play yourself by pressing space bar once a generation has died.

## Tests

There isn't really any tests yet, but I plan to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
to do some simple unit testing. The tests are located in './tests' and can be run
as follows:

```bash
node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/.bin/jest
```
